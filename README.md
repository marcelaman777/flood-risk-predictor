## üìã Project Overview

This comprehensive project implements a complete flood prediction pipeline featuring extensive exploratory data analysis, systematic benchmarking of multiple regression algorithms, and advanced Bayesian-optimized CatBoost modeling. The goal is to predict regional flood probability based on 20 environmental and infrastructural factors, achieving state-of-the-art performance through rigorous experimentation and sophisticated feature engineering.

**Competition Context**: This project is part of Kaggle's Playground Series S4E5 competition, where datasets were generated from a deep learning model trained on the original Flood Prediction Factors dataset.

## üéØ Objective

Predict flood probability (continuous target ranging from 0.285 to 0.725) through systematic comparison of linear and tree-based regression models, culminating in an advanced Bayesian-optimized CatBoost implementation with innovative feature engineering.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture

### Phase 1: Comprehensive EDA & Multi-Model Benchmarking
**File**: `flood-prediction-eda-linear-tree-based-models.ipynb`  
*Complete statistical analysis, distribution profiling, and systematic comparison of 15+ regression models across linear and tree-based families*

### Phase 2: Advanced Feature Engineering & Bayesian-Optimized CatBoost
**File**: `flood-prediction-catb-bayes-opt-target-enc.ipynb`  
*Sophisticated feature engineering with 24 statistical features, Gaussian process target encoding, and Bayesian-optimized CatBoost regression*

## üîç Comprehensive EDA Methodology

### 1. Data Profiling & Quality Assessment
- **Dataset Scale**: 1,117,957 training samples, 745,305 test samples
- **Feature Analysis**: All 20 features categorical (0-19 integer range)
- **Data Integrity**: Zero missing values, no duplicate records
- **Memory Optimization**: Strategic dtype selection (uint8 for features, float64 for target)

### 2. Advanced Distribution Analysis
**Statistical Insights**:
- **Poisson Distribution**: All features follow Œª=5 distribution, indicating synthetic generation
- **Distribution Consistency**: Train/test sets statistically identical (Anderson-Darling validation)
- **Central Tendency**: Median = 5 across all features, mode typically matches median
- **Quartile Analysis**: Identical upper quartiles across features, unusual but consistent

### 3. Target Variable Deep Dive
**FloodProbability Characteristics**:
- **Value Range**: 0.285 to 0.725 (continuous probability)
- **Value Cardinality**: Only 83 unique values from 1.1M+ records
- **Distribution Shape**: Approximately normal (bell curve distribution)
- **Statistical Moments**: Mean = 0.504, Median = 0.505, Mode = 0.490

### 4. Correlation & Relationship Mapping
**Multi-Method Correlation Analysis**: 
- Assuming that all features are actually ordinal:
  - **Feature-Target Correlations (Spearman's method)**: Minimal individual correlations (all < 0.18)
  - **Feature Inter-correlations (Spearman's method)**: Negligible relationships between predictors
- **Key Discovery**: Sum of features shows exceptional correlation (R¬≤ = 0.844) with target

### 5. Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis
**Pattern Recognition**:
- **Monotonic Relationships**: Consistent increase in flood probability with rising feature values
- **Ordinal Nature**: Clear ordinal relationships despite categorical representation

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Feature Engineering

### Statistical Feature Synthesis (24 New Features)

**Distribution Statistics**:
- `fmax`, `fmin`: Range indicators across feature set
- `fsum`: Aggregate risk score (highly predictive)
- `fmedian`: Central tendency measure
- `fstd`: Variability indicator
- `fmean+std`, `fmean-std`: Mean-variance boundaries

**Quantile Analysis**:
- Comprehensive percentile features (`fq10th` to `fq90th`)
- Interquartile range components (`fq25th`, `fq75th`)
- Distribution shape descriptors

**Higher-Order Moments**:
- `fsq_sum`, `fcb_sum`: Polynomial aggregates
- `fskew`, `fkurtosis`: Distribution shape metrics
- `fgeom_mean`, `fharm_mean`: Alternative central tendency measures

## Innovative Target Encoding

### Gaussian Process Encoding

```python
class TargetEncodingTransformer(TransformerMixin, BaseEstimator):
    '''Advanced target encoding using Gaussian Process Regression for smooth encoding'''
    
    def fit(self, X, y=None):
        # Calculate mean flood probability per fsum value
        # Implement GPR for robust encoding of unseen values
        # Create smooth encoding surface
```
